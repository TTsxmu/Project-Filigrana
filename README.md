# Project-Filigrana
Code for reading up to 3 DHT11 sensors (air humidity and temperature sensor) with an esp32 or aduino

Used to check the humidity and temperature inside plastic containers with filament spools like PLA, PETG or TPU to keep it dry. 
Also while heating the spool with the printer's bed.

ATM all the values ar displayed via Serial Port, but the idea is to install a round LCD display and a control panel to visualize all the values.
